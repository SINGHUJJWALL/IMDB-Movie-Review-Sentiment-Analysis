# 🎬 IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis  

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models. It classifies reviews as either **positive** or **negative** based on their sentiment.  

## 📂 Project Structure  

- `IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis-checkpoint.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.  
- `Model_Testing_&_Web_Application.ipynb` - Notebook for testing the trained model and deploying it as a web application.  
- `model.h5` - Pre-trained deep learning model for sentiment classification.  
- `tokenizer.pkl` - Tokenizer file used for text preprocessing.  

## 🛠️ Features  

✅ Sentiment classification of IMDb reviews (Positive/Negative)  
✅ Deep learning model using LSTM/GRU (modify if needed)  
✅ Web application for user-friendly interaction  
✅ Tokenizer-based preprocessing
